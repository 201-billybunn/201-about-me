## "About Me" Guessing Game

This is a guessing game with seven questions, built with some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript we've learned thusfar in week one of "Code 201" at Code Fellows in Seattle. 

## Motivation 

This is my week one project at Code Fellows' "Code 201" course. Each day, we had a "Lab" assignment which added requirements for us to build into our projects. Follow my journey into the world of coding [here on Twitter](https://twitter.com/billybunn).

## Project Requirements

### Lab 2
* Design a guessing game using the prompt() method.
* The questions in the guessing game must require a mix of yes/no answers, and user input must accept either y/n or yes/no responses, with either .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() used to validate the user input and accommodate users entering all-caps Y/N or YES/NO answers, too.
* Use useful and descriptive console.log() messages in the JS console. 
* Use some amount of CSS to style the page.
* Follow the Add, Commit, Push process. It should be evident in GitHub that commits are made regularly, and with good commit messages that explain the WHY of the commit.
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript must be cleanly written with correct indentation and syntax.
* Avoid declaring your own functions

### Lab 3

* Add a sixth question to my guessing game that takes numeric input by prompting a user to guess a number, and indicates to the user whether the guess is "too high" or "too low", and gives the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.
* Add a seventh question to my guessing game that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array, so that even more of my programming skills are showcased. For now, I will structure this question so that the user has six tries to get a single correct answer, and upon using up those tries OR getting a correct answer, displays a message to the user indicating all of the possible correct answers.
* Keep a tally of the total number of correct answers given by the user, and at the end of the game, tell the user how well they did with a personalized custom message that includes the number of correct answers and also addresses the user by name.

## How to use

The guessing game begins by clicking the button at the top of the page. If the game is played, each question is displayed on the page.
