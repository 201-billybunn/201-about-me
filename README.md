## "About Me" Guessing Game

This is a guessing game with yes/no questions, built with some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript we've learned thusfar in week one of "Code 201" at Code Fellows in Seattle. 

## Motivation 

This is my week one project at Code Fellows' "Code 201" course. Each day, we had a "Lab" assignment which added requirements for us to build into our projects. 

## Project Requirements

### Lab 2
* Design a guessing game using the prompt() method.
* The questions in the guessing game must require a mix of yes/no answers, and user input must accept either y/n or yes/no responses, with either .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() used to validate the user input and accommodate users entering all-caps Y/N or YES/NO answers, too.
* Use useful and descriptive console.log() messages in the JS console. 
* Use some amount of CSS to style the page.
* Follow the Add, Commit, Push process. It should be evident in GitHub that commits are made regularly, and with good commit messages that explain the WHY of the commit.
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript must be cleanly written with correct indentation and syntax.
* Avoid declaring your own functions

### Lab 3

* To be added

## How to use

The guessing game begins by clicking the button at the top of the page. If the game is played, each question is displayed on the page.
